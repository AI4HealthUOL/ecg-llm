What ECG signs suggest impending torsades de pointes?,"Drugs that block the repolarizing potassium current IKr, such as dofetilide, ibutilide, sotalol, and quinidine, are common offenders that can cause QT prolongation and torsades de pointes, and ECG signs that suggest impending torsades de pointes include widening and fattening of the T wave, prominent U waves, and a QTc interval >500 milliseconds.",LLama 3.1 70B + RAG,,,,x
"Which drugs (e.g., digoxin, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium) induce ECG changes that mimic ischemia? How can these be differentiated from true myocardial injury?","Digitalis, tricyclic antidepressants, and lithium can induce ECG changes that mimic ischemia, but they can be differentiated from true myocardial injury by looking for characteristic patterns such as a ""sagging"" ST segment in digitalis toxicity, a rightward shift of the terminal QRS vector and prolonged QRS duration in tricyclic antidepressant toxicity, and a shortened QT interval in lithium toxicity.",LLama 3.1 8B + RAG,,x,,
"Which drugs (e.g., digoxin, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium) induce ECG changes that mimic ischemia? How can these be differentiated from true myocardial injury?","These drugs can be differentiated from true myocardial injury by the presence of characteristic ECG changes, such as ST segment depression or T wave inversion, and by the absence of myocardial damage or elevated cardiac biomarkers.","Finetuned 8B: r=256, alpha=512",,,,x 
"Which drugs (e.g., digoxin, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium) induce ECG changes that mimic ischemia? How can these be differentiated from true myocardial injury?","Drugs such as digoxin, tricyclic antidepressants, and lithium can induce ECG changes that mimic ischemia, but these can be differentiated from true myocardial injury by characteristic patterns, such as a ""sagging"" ST segment in digitalis effect, and the presence of sinus tachycardia, prolonged QRS duration, and rightward shift of the terminal QRS vector in tricyclic antidepressant cardiotoxicity.",LLama 3.1 70B + RAG,,,,x
"Which drugs (e.g., digoxin, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium) induce ECG changes that mimic ischemia? How can these be differentiated from true myocardial injury?","These drugs can induce ECG changes that mimic ischemia, but they can also be differentiated from true myocardial injury by considering the clinical context, looking for typical side effects, and using additional diagnostic tests.","Finetuned 8B: r=256, alpha=256",,,,x 
"Which drugs (e.g., digoxin, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium) induce ECG changes that mimic ischemia?

"Which drugs (e.g., digoxin, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium) induce ECG changes that mimic ischemia? How can these be differentiated from true myocardial injury?","These drugs can cause ECG changes that mimic ischemia, but they have distinct characteristics, such as PR interval prolongation and T wave inversion in leads V1 and V2, and can be differentiated from true myocardial injury by their response to stress testing or other interventions.","Finetuned 70B: r=256, alpha=256",,x,,
"Which drugs (e.g., digoxin, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium) induce ECG changes that mimic ischemia?

"Which drugs (e.g., digoxin, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium) induce ECG changes that mimic ischemia? How can these be differentiated from true myocardial injury?","These drugs can induce ECG changes that mimic ischemia, but they can be differentiated from true myocardial injury by the presence of other signs of drug toxicity, such as hyperkalemia with digoxin or QRS widening with tricyclic antidepressants.","Finetuned 8B: r=64, alpha=16",,x,,
"Which drugs (e.g., digoxin, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium) induce ECG changes that mimic ischemia? How can these be differentiated from true myocardial injury?","Drugs such as digoxin, tricyclic antidepressants, and lithium can induce ECG changes that mimic ischemia, such as ST-segment elevation and T-wave inversion, but these can be differentiated from true myocardial injury by the presence of a normal troponin level and a lack of reciprocal ST-segment depression.",LLama 3.1 8B,,x,,
"Which drugs (e.g., digoxin, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium) induce ECG changes that mimic ischemia? How can these be differentiated from true myocardial injury?","Several medications including digoxin, tricyclic antidepressants, and lithium can cause ECG changes that mimic ischemia, but these can typically be differentiated from true myocardial injury by their characteristic patterns (such as digoxin's ""scooped"" ST segments), correlation with drug levels, absence of dynamic changes, and lack of corresponding cardiac biomarker elevation or clinical symptoms.",Claude 3.7 Sonnet,,,,x

How can these be differentiated from true myocardial injury?","Drugs such as digoxin, tricyclic antidepressants, and lithium can induce ECG changes that mimic ischemia, but these can be differentiated from true myocardial injury by considering the clinical context, serum levels of the drug, and the presence of other ECG changes not typical of ischemia.",LLama 3.1 70B,,,,x
